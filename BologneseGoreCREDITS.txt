Brutal Bolognese Gore mod by Sgt. Mark IV.

Sprites XDT1** - From Duke Nukem 3D
Sprites BLHT** and BLHN** - are based on effects from Team Fortress, but recolored by me.
Sprites XME8** - From Strife
Sprites XDB5** and BRIB** - Based on sprites from Blood (I think from a version recolored by Mike12), edited by me.
Sprites GUTS** - Based on sprites from Powerslave, animated by me.
Gore sounds from Half-Life and Postal

All other sprites are made by me, either edited from Doom, or made from scratch.
